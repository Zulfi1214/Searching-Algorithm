# Binary Search and Linear Search Implementation

## Purpose of the Code
The objective of this project is to implement Binary Search and Linear Search algorithms to gain hands-on experience with core data structures and searching techniques. Additionally, this project aims to reinforce the understanding of algorithmic time complexities, particularly for worst-case scenarios.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Zulfi1214/Searching-Algorithm`  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd Searching Algorithm`  
3. Run the program:  
   `python search_algorithms.py`  
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to test both Binary Search and Linear Search.

## Time Complexity

### Binary Search
- **Best Case**: O(1)  
  (The target is found at the middle index in the first comparison)  
- **Worst Case**: O(log n)  
  (The target is not in the list or requires maximum comparisons)

### Linear Search
- **Best Case**: O(1)  
  (The target is found at the first index)  
- **Worst Case**: O(n)  
  (The target is not in the list, requiring all elements to be scanned)

---

## Worst Case for Binary Search (O(log n))
The worst-case scenario for Binary Search occurs when the target value is not present in the sorted list or is positioned such that it requires the maximum number of comparisons. This is demonstrated in the program with an example.

---

## Features
- Clear implementation of both searching algorithms.
- Demonstration of worst-case scenarios for Binary Search.
- Easy-to-understand and well-documented code.

---

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understanding of Binary and Linear Search algorithms.
2. Practical knowledge of time complexities and their implications.
3. Experience in documenting and sharing code via GitHub.
